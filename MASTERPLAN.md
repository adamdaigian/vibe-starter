## Vision

[One sentence describing the end state you're building toward]

**Example:** *"A platform where data analysts can query any database with natural language and get instant visualizations."*

## Problem Statement

## Success Criteria

How do we know we've won?

| Metric | Target | Timeline |
|--------|--------|----------|
| [Metric 1] | [Target] | [When] |
| [Metric 2] | [Target] | [When] |

## Core Features (MVP)

What's the minimum set of features to validate the idea?

1. **[Feature 1]** — [Why it's essential]
2. **[Feature 2]** — [Why it's essential]
3. **[Feature 3]** — [Why it's essential]

## Non-Goals (Explicitly Out of Scope)

What are we NOT building? This is just as important.

- ❌ [Thing we're not doing]

| Database | Supabase | Auth + DB + Realtime in one |
| Deployment | Vercel | Zero-config, preview deploys |

## Timeline

|-------|-------|----------|
| Phase 1 | Core MVP | 2 weeks |
| Phase 2 | Polish + Launch | 1 week |
| Phase 3 | Iterate on feedback | Ongoing |
